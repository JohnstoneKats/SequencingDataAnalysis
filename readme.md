# Analysis of next-gen sequencing data

This folder contains scripts for general analysis and figure generation. Please annotate extensively and define all input and output files within your scripts for ease of use.

### Analysis includes: 

**1. RNA-seq**
* 3' RNA-seq (single end) 
* with ERCC spike-in
* Differential gene expression analysis

**2. ChIP-seq**

* Single-end 
* Paired-end
* with DM3 and/or ERCC spike-in
* Traditional peak calling 
* Window-based enrichment analysis
* Differential peak calling
* PolII ChIP-seq analysis

**3. ATAC-seq**

**4. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing**

* Single end 
* Paired end with enhanced mapping efficiency
* Differential methylation analysis

**5. M6A-seq**

**6. CRISPR screen analysis**
