# Analysis of Next-Gen sequencing data

This folder contains scripts for general analysis and figure generation. Please annotate extensively and define all input and output files within your scripts for ease of use.

### Analysis includes: 

#1. RNA-seq
* total RNA-seq (paired end)
* 3' RNA-seq (single end) 
* with ERCC spike-in
* PRO-seq/TT-seq
* GRO-seq
* SLAM-seq


#2. ChIP-seq 

* Single-end 
* Paired-end
* with DM3 spike-in
* Traditional differential peak calling analysis
* Window-based differential analysis
* PolII ChIP-seq analysis


#3. ATAC-seq


#4. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing

* Single end 
* Paired end

#5. M6A-seq
