# Analysis of Next-Gen sequencing data

This folder contains scripts for general analysis and figure generation. 
please annotate extensively and define all input and output files within your scripts for ease of use.

Analysis includes: 

1) RNA-seq
1.1) total RNA-seq
1.2)  3' RNA-seq
1.3)  with ERCC spike-in
1.4) PRO-seq/TT-seq
1.5) GRO-seq
1.6) SLAM-seq


2. ChIP-seq 

2.1 Single-end 

2.2 Paired-end

2.3 with DM3 spike-in

2.4 with traditional differential peak calling analysis

2.5 with window-based differential analysis


3. ATAC-seq


4. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing

4.1 with enhanced mapping efficiency
